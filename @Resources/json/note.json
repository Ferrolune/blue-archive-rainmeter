        "DO NOT USE THIS SKIN TO STORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION. There is a SINGULAR feature that warns you about marked files so they are not immediately leaked, but it is NOT proper security. Store your passwords elsewhere.",
        "The [File ID] will only accept a numeric input. Rainmeter may permit negative and decimal numbers, but the script will simply ignore those characters (i.e. 123 is the same as -1.23), so keep that in mind.",
        "Changing\/removing the last occurence of a File ID after its initial creation will destroy the file and all its contents, so do so with caution.",
        "If you wish to not use a file but save it for future use, disable the entry instead of outright deleting it so the file is preserved.",
        "Multiple entries can share the same File ID, linking them to the same .txt file. Why you would want to do that, I do not know."
