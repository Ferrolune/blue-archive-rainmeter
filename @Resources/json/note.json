        "The [File ID] will only accept a numeric input. Rainmeter may permit negative and decimal numbers, but the script will simply ignore those characters (i.e. 123 is the same as -1.23), so keep that in mind.",
        "Changing the last occurence of a File ID after its initial creation and parsed will destroy all its contents, so do so with caution.",
        "Deleting an entry from the database will also delete the associated [file_id].txt file. If you wish to only deactivate it, make sure you disable it instead so the file is preserved.",
        "Multiple entries can share the same File ID, linking them to the same .txt file. Why you would want to do that, I don't know.",
        "DO NOT USE THIS SKIN TO STORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION. There is a SINGULAR feature that warns you about marked files so they are not immediately leaked, but it is NOT proper security. Store your passwords elsewhere."
